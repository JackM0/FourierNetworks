Every few basis functions look very much like the Hermit polynomials, however eventually they stop looking like them

You get more looking like Hermite polynomials if you use more copies of the original 2PSE, so perhaps the ones that dont look like the Hermite polynomials are mistakes

The ones that do look like Hermit polynomials appear in the same order as the order of the polynomial they represent

The ones that do look like hermite polynomials hae the checker pattern, unless you do the opposite fft shift

Also it does seem when i increase the number of 2pse used, some of the "noise" is removed from the basis functions
